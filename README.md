# CSCI4110U Project - Solar System Animation

## Introduction

The following project was created by Eyaz Rehman and Rameet Sekhon. We decided to create a journey into the solar system, following spaceships on their journey. You can travel alongside them witnessing majestic animations and maneuvers while seeing the sun expand and contract lighting up the solar system and plunging it back into darkness. We hope you enjoy the journey to the center of the solar system.

#### How to operate project
- Arrow keys: Switch between planets/stars/ships
- R: Reset animation of ships
- C: Pause camera
- Mouse wheel: Scroll to zoom in and out

#### Features:
- Sun expands and retracts, as the Sun retracts light dims, while light increases as Sun's size does
- Skybox displayed with dynamically twinkling stars in the background (pause camera to see them stars twinkle more clearly)
- 4 Ships that all have unique key frame animations
- Entire solar system rendered with all Terrestrial planets and Jovian planets with textures and orbits
- Dynamic lighting
- Entire backend coded from scratch, none of in class labs or projects were used
